This detailed breakdown transforms Activity #2: The Resignation Protocol into a fully immersive, visually interactive feature. This design prioritizes the somatic experience of "letting go," ensuring the user (Matthew) feels the weight of the action.
Activity #2: The Resignation Protocol
Concept: A digital ritual where Matthew formally resigns from the exhausting, unpaid roles he has unconsciously taken on (e.g., General Manager of the Universe, Chief Worrier, Director of People Pleasing).
1. The Atmosphere (UI/Visuals)
Instead of a standard app interface, this screen feels like a private study or a legal sanctuary.
 * Background: The stark white of the app dims to a warm, textured "cream paper" tone. Subtle grain makes it feel like physical stationery.
 * Typography: The static text of the resignation letter uses a sharp, monospaced typewriter font (e.g., Courier Prime or American Typewriter). This signifies "official business."
 * The "Ink": Matthew's inputs appear in a contrasting, "handwritten" script font (e.g., Caveat or Permanent Marker) in a deep indigo or teal color. This visually separates the structure of the ritual from his personal truth.
 * Sound Design:
   * Typing: Soft, mechanical clacks as the app reveals the static text.
   * Input: A scratching "pen on paper" sound when Matthew selects or types his answers.
2. The Interactive Workflow (The "Mad Libs" Poem)
The letter is not presented all at once. It unfolds stanza by stanza to prevent overwhelm, creating a narrative flow.
Phase 1: The Header
 * Animation: The header stamps onto the screen like a fax receiving a document.
 * Prompt: "Who are you addressing?"
 * Interactive Field: TO: [ ____________ ]
   * Dropdown Suggestions: The Anxiety, The Inner Critic, The Past Version of Me, The Committee.
   * Custom Input: Matthew can type "My Mother's Expectations."
Phase 2: The Role
 * Text appears: "Please accept this letter as formal notification that I am resigning from my position as..."
 * Interactive Field: [ ____________ ]
   * Dropdown Suggestions: General Manager of the Universe, Chief Fixer, The Emotional Sponge, The Peacekeeper.
   * Effect: When selected, the text locks in with a heavy "thud" sound, acknowledging the weight of the title.
Phase 3: The Grievances (The "Why")
 * Text appears: "I am stepping down because the working conditions have become..."
 * Interactive Field 1: [ ____________ ] (e.g., Unbearable, Soul-crushing, Unsustainable)
 * Text continues: "For too long, I have been paid in..."
 * Interactive Field 2: [ ____________ ] (e.g., Panic attacks, Resentment, Fake smiles)
 * Text finishes: "...instead of..."
 * Interactive Field 3: [ ____________ ] (e.g., Authenticity, Rest, Joy)
Phase 4: The Surrender of Assets
 * Text appears: "Effective immediately, I am returning the keys to..."
 * Interactive Field: [ ____________ ]
   * Suggestions: The Control Room, Tomorrow's Problems, Other People's Crises.
 * Text continues: "And I will no longer be responsible for..."
 * Interactive Checklist: (Matthew taps to cross these out with a red strikethrough animation)
   * [Tap to Strike] Predicting catastrophic futures
   * [Tap to Strike] Managing emotions that aren't mine
   * [Tap to Strike] Apologizing for taking up space
Phase 5: The New Appointment
 * Text appears: "Moving forward, I will be accepting a new position as..."
 * Interactive Field: [ ____________ ]
   * Suggestions: The Protector of My Peace, The Architect of My Own Life, Just Matt.
3. The Signing Ritual (Somatic Engagement)
This is the climax of the activity. It requires physical effort to make the commitment feel binding.
 * Orientation Shift: The app pauses and gently pulses, displaying an icon instructing Matthew to rotate his phone to landscape.
 * The Canvas: The screen becomes a wide signature line at the bottom of the document.
 * The Action: Matthew must use his index finger to sign his name.
 * Haptics:
   * As his finger drags across the screen, the phone emits a friction-based vibration—grainy and continuous—simulating the drag of a fountain pen on heavy paper.
   * If he lifts his finger, the vibration stops instantly.
   * Visual: The signature appears in "wet ink" that glistens slightly before drying to matte.
4. Post-Submission (The Release)
Once the signature is complete, a "Seal of Approval" stamps onto the document. Matthew is then given two distinct paths for how to process this resignation.
Option A: The Burn (Cathartic Release)
 * Best for: Letting go of anger, trauma, or heavy burdens.
 * Visual: The letter crumples into a ball in the center of the screen.
 * Interaction: Matthew must "flick" the ball toward a fire pit animation at the top of the screen.
 * Animation: The paper catches fire. It doesn't just disappear; it turns black, curls, and flakes into gray ash.
 * Haptic: A low, rumbling vibration mimics the roar of a fire.
 * Closing: The ash blows away, revealing the word "RELEASED" in clean, airy text.
Option B: The File (Setting a Boundary)
 * Best for: establishing new rules, changing habits, or stopping people-pleasing.
 * Visual: The letter is neatly folded into thirds.
 * Interaction: A "Past Contracts" file cabinet drawer slides up. Matthew drags the folded letter into the folder.
 * Sound: A satisfying, heavy thump of a drawer slamming shut.
 * Visual: A red wax seal stamps the folder: "CASE CLOSED."
 * Utility: This letter is saved in his profile. If he finds himself people-pleasing again, the app can "remind" him: "You resigned from this position on [Date]. Do you need to view your contract?"
