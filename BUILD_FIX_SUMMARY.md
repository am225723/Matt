# Build Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing `initializeGemini` Export in `src/ExcuseReframe.jsx`
**Problem**: The component was trying to import `initializeGemini` from `src/prompts/excuseReframe.js`, but this function didn't exist.
**Solution**: 
- Removed the `initializeGemini` import from `excuseReframe.js`
- Added import for `initializePerplexity` from `@/utils/perplexity`
- Updated the API key environment variable from `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` to `VITE_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`

### 2. Missing `initializeGemini` Export in `src/YardageBook.jsx`
**Problem**: Similar issue - trying to import `initializeGemini` (aliased as `initializeYardageBook`) from `src/prompts/yardageBook.js`, but this function didn't exist.
**Solution**:
- Removed the `initializeGemini as initializeYardageBook` import from `yardageBook.js`
- Added import for `initializePerplexity` from `@/utils/perplexity`
- Updated the function call from `initializeYardageBook(apiKey)` to `initializePerplexity(apiKey)`
- Updated the API key environment variable from `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` to `VITE_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`

## Root Cause
The application was originally designed to use Gemini AI but was refactored to use Perplexity AI. However, some components still had references to the old Gemini implementation that no longer existed.

## Files Modified
1. `src/ExcuseReframe.jsx` - Fixed imports and API key reference
2. `src/YardageBook.jsx` - Fixed imports and API key reference

## Environment Variables
Make sure your environment variables are set correctly:
- `VITE_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` - Your Perplexity AI API key

## Build Status
âœ… Build successful - all import errors resolved
